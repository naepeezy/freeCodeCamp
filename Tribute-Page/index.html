            <p>Born November 26th 1933 in the village of Ilanga, Spanish
                Honduras, Dr. Sebi came into this world as <a href="https://drsebiscellfood.com/pages/drsebi"
                    id="tribute-link" target="_blank"> Alfredo
                    Bowman.</a> Young Alfredo did not attend formal school;
                he was raised and educated by his cherished grandmother, Mama Hay, who influenced his understanding of
                "Mama Hay is the pillar of my
                foundation," Dr. Sebi said. <br><br>
                "She is the very pillar in which all of the things that I have done lays."Dr. Sebi’s fascination with
                the natural world around him sparked a lifelong interest in the healing properties of plants. As a young
                man with asthma, diabetes, impotence and obesity, Dr. Sebi was drawn to natural healing methods,
                especially after discovering firsthand the limitations of Western medicine in treating chronic disease.

        <h1 class="sections">African and American Herbal Wisdom</h1>
        <p> Dr. Sebi studied herbs in Africa, the Caribbean, North America, and Central and South America. In
            Mexico
            he met an herbalist who alleviated all of his health complaints and explained to him that being from
            Africa, he should follow an original African diet! Inspired by the mighty healing potential of
            herbs,
            Dr. Sebi went on to create natural vegetation cell food compounds that clean and replenish the body,
            the
            first prototypes of Dr. Sebi’s Cell Food.
